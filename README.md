# Soccer-Score-Predictor

An advanced machine learning application designed to predict soccer match outcomes based on historical data, player statistics, and team performance. This project integrates data from past matches, player performance metrics, and team histories to deliver accurate match result predictions. Built using Python, scikit-learn, pandas, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project leverages data science and machine learning techniques to analyze and forecast outcomes in the exciting world of soccer.

Key Features

Data Integration:

Collects and integrates soccer match data, player statistics, and team performance metrics.

Utilizes advanced web scraping techniques to extract relevant data from online sources.

Rolling Feature Engineering:

Implements rolling averages and other aggregations to capture historical trends in team and player performance.

Machine Learning Models:

Employs machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest Classifier) from scikit-learn to predict match outcomes.

Evaluates model performance using precision scores and other metrics.

Interactive Interface:

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly interface for exploring predictions.

Project Overview

Data Collection:

Extract data from past soccer matches using web scraping (e.g., scraping.ipynb).

Preprocess and clean the dataset to ensure consistency.

Feature Engineering:

Create rolling averages and additional predictive metrics for each team.

Examples include goals scored, shots on target, distance covered, and fouls committed.

Model Training:

Split data into training and testing sets based on date thresholds.

Train a Random Forest Classifier using historical match statistics and engineered features.

Prediction:

Make predictions on unseen data and evaluate model performance.

Output actual vs. predicted results for analysis.

Visualization:

Display results interactively in an HTML interface.
